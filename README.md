# Impact of Temperature Changes on Economic Growth: An Analysis of Wealthy and Poor Countries

In this project, I studied the impact of temperature on economic growth, with a focus on whether poorer countries are more affected by rising temperatures than wealthier ones in the context of global warming.

I based my approach on the methodology of Dell et al. (2012). First, I replicated their work and then extended the period of analysis by an additional 11 years, resulting in approximately 37% more observations
As part of this, I also reviewed data revisions and corrections made by the World Bank, since updated GDP data slightly altered the original results of Dell et al. (2012).

The paper accompanying this project will be uploaded in the coming days â€” I am currently finalizing the last specifications.
