# Seminar Econometrics

In the Econometrics seminar I am attending this semester, I am exploring the topic "Impact of Temperature Changes on Agricultural Performance: A comparative analysis of Wealthy and Poorer Countries." This research is similar to the paper "Temperature Shocks and Economic Growth" by Melissa Dell. Therefore, I am currently studying her work and upload aspects of it here.

So far, my focus has mainly been on creating visuals of the dataset using the R.
