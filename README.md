# Seminar Econometrics

In the Econometrics seminar I am attending this semester, I am exploring the topic "Impact of Temperature Changes on Agricultural Performance: A comparative analysis of Wealthy and Poorer Countries." This research is similar to the paper "Temperature Shocks and Economic Growth" by Melissa Dell, which addresses my and other questions in more depth. Therefore, I am currently studying her work and upload aspects of it here.

So far, my focus has mainly been on creating visual representations of the dataset using the R.
